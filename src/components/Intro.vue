          Love to do coding everyday to increase problem solving capabilities.
          Attending several coding contest on various online coding platform. I
          enjoy automating everyday task using Python. The idea of enabling a
          machine to learn strikes me. To keep myself updated, I tend to do
          projects that require constant brushing up, learning and research on
          various ML libraries. Apart from that, I also spend my time in
          Web-Developing, where i got to learn new things everyday and chances
          to work on various framework. Hence I see myself enjoying it as my
          full time profession.

          I aspire to be working on Machine Learning to enhance my skills and
          knowledge to a point where I can find myself comfortable to contribute
          and bring a change, regardless of how small it may be.
